I'm looking at how dataflow expression editing can be added to charmapper.
One of the main ideas is that we can have three modes for editing expressions:
* Interactive mode
  * There are predefined expression types and all the inputs for that
    expression type are presented like a propery editor.
* Expression mode
  * A text area is provided to type in the expression.
  * Expressions are
    a = b + c;
    d = e + f;
    a + d
* Node mode
  * The expression is represented as a set of nodes that represent
    an expression tree.
  * Each node has a single output and zero or more inputs.
  * Outputs can be expanded to extract members.
  * The default operation for dragging on a node is making a connection.
    * Moving a node involves selecting it, which produces something like
      a title-bar that you can drag to move the node.

Nodes have regular inputs and outputs on the left and right.
Nodes have an environment input on the top and an environment output on
the bottom.

A special code node contains internal logic.
It only has one output, which is the code.
Internally, it has an env input at the top and an env output at the bottom.

Let's call it a block.

You can have text blocks or diagram blocks.

{a = x;b = y;} // text block

A block is a function which takes an environment and returns an environment.

Functions can be created from blocks:
  function(inputs=['x','y'],outputs=['a','b'],code={a=x;b=y;})

*|condition=$                        |
*|then_block=$                       |
*|else_block=$                       |
 |if(condition,then_block,else_block)|*

*|if input:  |
*|  exec     |
 |else:      |
*|  exec     |

Maybe if we have an output inside a loop, it creates a list:

  *|for x in input:|
   |  output x     |*--*|list(*input)|*

Inputting an outputting lists:

  *|let [x,y,z]=input   |
   |      output [z,y,x]|*

We could have special connectors which look like outputs, but are actually
inputs.  They form a block from whatever they are connected to.

Should we have a scope node that creates a new environment with the current
environment as its parent?

|let y = 4      |
|let x = 4      |
|scope{continue}|*----+
|output y       |*----|---- (6)
|output x       |*----|---- (4)
                      *
                 |let x = 5|
                 |y = 6    |


If we have continuations, can we create blocks like this?

      |let block={continue}|*---- (connect to nodes which form the block)
      |        output block|*---- (this is the resulting block)


 *|let yes=input                  |
 *|let no=input                   |
 *|let condition=input            |
  |output yes if condition else no|*

I think I want to start integrating this with Qt widgets.
I want to be able to add a slider, then put in some logic that does something
with the slider, and then show the result.

Maybe something where we add three sliders for R,G,B, then use a diagram
to turn those into a color, and then display the color.
---
It would be neat if you could select some text in a node, then drag it out
and have it create a new node with the text, replace the text in the original
node with a $ and attach the new node's output to a new input connector.
---
Maybe a good thing to work on is being able to draw a spline.
We'll need a way to create a window, create a drawing area within the
window, and then provide a diagram that generates what we will draw.
---
If a node in a diagram gets wider, it should push nodes that are connected
to it to the right.
---
We could simply wrappers by not having operationNames and executeOperation
members, and just having wrappers for Events.  We could create a menu by
going through all the children and finding those which were events.

We'd need to have it so that we don't get state for event children.
Maybe there's a general principle that we don't add children that have no
value and no children.

It's interesting that we could have events that have children, and the
children could represent parameters, like a function call.
---
If we have a minimum and maximum value for a variable.  Use a slider
instead of a spin box for the value.

The slider needs to show the value.  There isn't a Qt widget that has a
slider combined with a text field, so we'll need to make one.
