I'm looking at how dataflow expression editing can be added to charmapper.
One of the main ideas is that we can have three modes for editing expressions:
* Interactive mode
  * There are predefined expression types and all the inputs for that
    expression type are presented like a propery editor.
* Expression mode
  * A text area is provided to type in the expression.
  * Expressions are
    a = b + c;
    d = e + f;
    a + d
* Node mode
  * The expression is represented as a set of nodes that represent
    an expression tree.
  * Each node has a single output and zero or more inputs.
  * Outputs can be expanded to extract members.
  * The default operation for dragging on a node is making a connection.
    * Moving a node involves selecting it, which produces something like
      a title-bar that you can drag to move the node.
