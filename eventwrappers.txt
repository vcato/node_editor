We could simplify wrappers by not having operationNames and executeOperation
members, and just having wrappers for Events.  We could create a menu by
going through all the children and finding those which were events.

We'd need to have it so that we don't get state for event children.
Maybe there's a general principle that we don't add children that have no
value and no children.

It's interesting that we could have events that have children, and the
children could represent parameters, like a function call.
